"""A reply is written with the whole conversation, not its last six messages.

Issue #97: a requirement the prospect stated early in a thread ("synthetic
data only, processed in the EU") fell out of the six-message window and the
draft contradicted it. Cold-email threads are short, so the whole thread
normally fits; a very long one keeps the latest messages and the prospect's
own earlier words first, and says what it left out.
